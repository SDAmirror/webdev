    <h1 >What is chemistry ?</h1>
    <p>Chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes. Every substance, whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species of atoms that have been identified as elements. Although these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary particles, they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold, for example, smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain but with the properties of atoms and the laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these properties can be used to achieve specific purposes.</p>

    <h1 id="why">Why do we need chemistry</h1>
    <img hspace="10"  vspace="10" align="left" class="conimg" src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/i8f4J8W7MA1J-BsikwcrizDcgnI=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-563876763-488af0444ebf4e429ae485b417f9355c.jpg" alt=""><p>Why is chemistry important? If you take chemistry or teach chemistry, you'll be asked to answer this question pretty often. It's easy to say chemistry is important because everything is made from chemicals but there are a lot of other reasons why chemistry is a big part of daily life and why everyone should understand basic chemistry. If you've ever wondered about the question yourself, this selection of answers from real chemists, teachers, students, and readers just like you will give you an idea of the many reasons why chemistry is so vital to our lives.</p>
    <p><b>We Are Chemical Beings:</b> Many biology and anatomy and physiology courses begin with chemistry. More than just nutrients, medicines and poisons, everything we do is chemical. Geology too: why do we wear diamonds and not calcium carbonate on our fingers?
        —foxkin</p>
    <p><b>Importance of Chemistry to Life: </b> (1) Many thing that are our in environment are made of chemicals. (2) Many things that we observe in the world are made of chemical effects.
        —Shola  </p>
    <p><b>Prevents Poisoning or Worse:</b>  Water or sulfuric acid? Propylene glycol or ethylene glycol? It's good to be able to tell them apart. Chemistry is important because it helps you identify toxic or dangerous substances. Of course, labeling your chemicals helps a lot too.
        —Gemdragon
        Chemistry [has] great importance in our daily life... In our [bodies,] chemical reactions are going on. With the help of chemistry, we are able to cure most deadly or dangerous diseases. By the study of chemistry, we can learn the biochemical changes going on in our body.
        —Sneha Jadhao
        Chemistry is a path of creativity, at least to me. It's a subject of logic and it creates a new way of thinking... Organic is like a puzzle which is very interesting to solve and bonding is just awesome. Chemistry is a study of life. Life is made of a string of particulate matter.
        —Dr. C. W. Huey
        Because chemistry is all over in world & girls are impressed by this subject.

        <b>Life is Made up of Chemistry: </b> For me, chemistry is very interesting because I feel by learning it we can understand the other sciences too. My specialization is in analytical [chemistry.] This tells us about nutritional values, specimen analysis, toxicity, sampling, and so many valuable things. So chem is around us and inside us. Moreover, with today's instrumentation and with the help of a large variety of chemical measurements available, we can get the results of clinical, environmental, occupational health, safety applications, and industrial analysis.
